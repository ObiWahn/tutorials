#The Lesser Languages

Many software projects seem to have a severe lack of respect for all
of their plumbing needed to actually build the project. Glue code
and build systems tend to be treated with far less respect than the
main project language probably through a combination of ignorance and
indifference.

This lack of care tends to result in half working builds, builds that
do too much work or too little and generally wastes everyone's time
requiring almost constant hacks and workarounds to account for the
original authors taciturn assumptions about the environment.

Arrogance also plays a part in guaranteeing the status quo never
improves. By accepting that these tools are beneath abilities of the
author it becomes easier for them to discard any value they might
have.
